### Releases

Metro 5 releases frequently. I create release when there are significant bug fixes, new APIs or components.

### LTS
**Long term support** of older versions of Metro 5 does not currently exist.
If your current version of Metro 5 works for you, you can stay on it for as long as you'd like.
If you want to make use of new features as they come in you should upgrade to a newer version.
